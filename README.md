# DROWSINESS-DETECTION-AND-ENGINE-LOCK-SYSTEM-PROJECT
1 INTRODUCTION

 Drowsy driving is a significant contributor to road accidents, leading to thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that fatigue is a factor in about 100,000 police-reported crashes annually in the United States alone. 

1.1 Purpose

Despite growing awareness of this issue, many drivers underestimate the dangers of driving while drowsy. As a result, there is an urgent need for effective solutions to mitigate this risk. 

Recent advancements in technology offer promising avenues for addressing drowsiness detection.Innovations in machine learning, computer vision, and wearable sensors have enabled the development of systems that can monitor a driver's state in real time.

 By analyzing behavioral indicators such as eye movements, facial expressions, and physiological signals, these systems can provide timely alerts when drowsiness is detected. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution that combines drowsiness detection with an engine lock mechanism. 

1.2 System overview

The core idea is to create a safety system that not only alerts drivers to their diminishing alertness but also prevents vehicle operation when a certain level of drowsiness is reached.

 This dual approach serves to enhance road safety by reducing the likelihood of accidents and promoting responsible driving behavior.

 The following sections will detail the methodologies employed in developing the drowsiness detection algorithm, the design and functionality of the engine lock mechanism, and the results of preliminary testing that demonstrate the system's effectiveness.
